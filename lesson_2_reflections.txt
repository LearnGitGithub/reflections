What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

a hidden directory called .git is created with some metadata to keep
track of the history of changes, etc.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
  repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a mediator or stepping stone between the two.
It allows batching.
