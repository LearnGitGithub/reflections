When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping
all your work local?

When you want to have a backup or collaborate with someone else.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because the changes made remotely may have been done by a collaborator and
may break your code if pulled automatically by Git.
